# Photon Text Adventure
I made this game for fun. It is a text-adventure game I made with branches and variables and the like.


## Requirements
I made this game with linux in mind, so any os.system() calls will be scuffed on other platforms. Also, you need to have pygame installed and able to be used for the audio to play.
