# Photon Text Adventure
I made this game for fun. It is a text-adventure game I made with branches and variables and the like.


## Requirements
I made this game with linux in mind, so any os.system() calls will be scuffed on other platforms. Also, you need to have pygame and colorama installed and able to be used. Pygame is used for the audio to play, and colorama is used for changing text color.


## Please Note
To enable audio without the audio files will cause a program crash. If you don't have the audio files, use no audio mode.
